            <h1>Re: Eileen Dover university application</h1>
            <p>Dear Eileen,</p>
            <p>Thank you for you recent appliction to join us the University of Aweosome's science faculty to study as part <br/> could start at the beginning of a semester; the start dates for each one are as follows:</p>
            <h2>Starting dates</h2>
            <p>We are happy to accomodate you starting your study with us at any time, however it would suit us better if you <br/> could start the beginning of a semester; the dates for each one are as follows:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>First semester: 9 September 2016</li>
                <li>Second semester: 15 January 2017 </li>
                <li>Third semester: 2 May 2017 </li>
            </ul>
            <p> Please let me know if this is ok, and if so which start date you would prefer.</p>
            <p>You can find more information about <a href="#"> important university dates</a> on our website.</p>
            <h2>Subjects of study</h2>
            <p>At the aweosome Science Faculty, we have a pretty open-minded research facility -- as long as the subjets fall <br/> somewhere in the real of science and technology. You seem like an intelligent, dedicated researcher, and just<br/> the kind
                of person we'd like to have on ou team. Saying that, of the ideas you submitted we were most intrigued <br/> by are as follows, in order of priority:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Turning H<sub>2</sub>O into wine,and the health benefits of Resveratol (C<sub>14</sub>H<sub>12</sub>>O <sub>3</sub>).
                </li>
                <li>Measuring the effect on performance of funk bassplayers at tempratures exceeding 30°C (86°F), when the <br/> audience size exponentially increases (effect of 3*10<sup>3</sup>> 3*10<sup>4</sup>).
                </li>
                <li>HTML and CSS contructs for representing musical scores.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>So please can you provide more information on each of these subjets, including how long you'd expect the <br/> research to take, required staff and other resources, and anything else you thing we'd need to know? Thanks.</p>
            <h2>Exotic dance moves</h2>
            <p>Yes. you are right! As part of my post-doctorate work, I did study exotic tribal dances. To answer your question, <br/> my favourite dances are as follows, with definitions:</p>
            <p>Plynesian chicken dance</p>
            <p class="p1"> A little known but very influential dance dating back as far as 300BC. a whole village would dance around <br/> in a cicle like chikens, to encourage their livestock or be "fruitfil". </p>
            <p>Icelandic bronian shuffle</p>
            <p class="p1">Before the Icelander developed fire as a means of getting warms, they used to practice this dance, which <br/> involved huddling close together in a circle on the floor, and a shuffling their bodies around in imperceptably <br/> very rapid
                movements. One of my fellow students used to say that he thought this dance inspired <br/> modem styles such as Tweking.
            </p>
            <p>Artic robot dance</p>
            <p class="p1">An interesting example of historic misinformation, english explorers in the 1960<small>s</small> belivied to have <br/> discovered a new dance style characterised by "robotic", stiled movements, being practiced by inhabitants <br/> of Northern
                Alaska and Canada. Later on however it was discovered that they were just moving like this <br/> because they were really cold.
            </p>

            <p>Yours sincerely.</p>
